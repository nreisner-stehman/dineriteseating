                <p class = 'testimonial_text'>We have worked with Dine Rite Seating and their talented team on ten projects up and down the East coast for the past eight years. To put it simply; out of all of the vendors we work with, DRS is in a class by themselves when it relates to craftsmanship, value and most importantly; customer service. They have the most professional organization and have a proven capacity and understanding to take on large and small projects. I would strongly recommend DRS to anyone who asks for a top-notch custom furniture manufacturer.</p>

            <p class = 'testimonial_text'>For the past ten years, we have worked with DRS on ten unique projects. Our experience has been very positive and found their engineering and design capabilities first rate. When we place an order, we never have to worry about follow-up. Their qualified staff keeps the lines of communications open and the details of our order are always quick and concise. DRS is dependable, professional and knowledgeable and we are always satisfied with the work that they have done. Their dependability and quality workmanship has helped our relationship flourish. When it comes to custom manufactured furniture, I would only call one company; Dine Rite Seating.</p>

            <p class = 'testimonial_text'>We are not one to send accolades for companies that we do business with; however Dine Rite Seating is an exception. They are always a pleasure to work with and we can sum DRS with three words: SERVICE...SERVICE...SERVICE! DRS truly care about each piece of furniture that they produce with special detail to quality. They pay attention to our sometimes critical delivery dates and provide efficient professional and courteous service. Communication between our companies is clear and precise. DRS at times will assist us with details to value engineer our original shop drawings to meet the client's budget without sacrificing the overall design of the project. When working with project managers, architects and millwork companies, we refer DRS as a first-rate producer of custom furniture and upholstery. Having worked with DRS for over 20 years, they are a unique commodity and are like no other supplier of their kind. We can honestly call them family.</p>
